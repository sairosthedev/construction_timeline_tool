# Construction Timeline Prediction Tool

## Overview
The Construction Timeline Prediction Tool is a web-based platform designed to predict delays in construction projects. This application provides actionable insights to help stakeholders mitigate risks and streamline project execution.

## Key Features
- **Delay Prediction**: Predict construction project delays based on input factors.
- **Interactive Interface**: User-friendly web application for data input and result visualization.
- **Secure Backend**: Handles user authentication, data storage, and machine learning model integration.
- **Scalability**: Built to handle multiple users and large datasets efficiently.

## Tech Stack
- **Frontend**: React (with Vite for fast development)
- **Backend**: Node.js with Express (REST API)
- **Database**: MongoDB (via Mongoose for schema modeling)
- **Machine Learning**: Python (scikit-learn or TensorFlow)
- **Hosting**: AWS or Heroku for deployment

## Getting Started
1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd construction-timeline-frontend
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:
   ```
   npm install
   ```

3. **Run the application**:
   ```
   npm run dev
   ```

4. **Open your browser** and navigate to `http://localhost:3000` to view the application.

## API Endpoints
- **Authentication**:
  - `POST /api/auth/register`: Register a new user.
  - `POST /api/auth/login`: Log in an existing user.

- **Project Management**:
  - `GET /api/projects`: List all projects for a user.
  - `POST /api/projects`: Add a new project.
  - `PUT /api/projects/:id`: Update project details.
  - `DELETE /api/projects/:id`: Delete a project.

- **Predictions**:
  - `POST /api/predict`: Submit project data and get a delay prediction.

## Future Enhancements
- Integrate real-time weather data for more accurate predictions.
- Add analytics dashboards for trend visualization.
- Enable support for multiple languages.
- Use advanced ML techniques for better predictions.
